		<h1>a parking appeal.</h1>
		<p style="text-align:right">Written to the City of Madison on December 6th, 2018</p>
		<p>I came back to Madison after traveling for thanksgiving an hour before the badger game started. I couldn't park at my house because my landlord sells our parking spots for gameday - and I didn't want to pay $20 to park in my own neighborhood. I found a spot in a circle near the zoo where I got the parking ticket. I drove around the circle, looked for parking restriction signs, and didn't see any that had restrictions on Saturday parking. (The ticket I got says there were 8-6 posted in clear view). When I finished my lap I parked in the first space I saw. Unfortunately, this was directly in front of the one sign that mentioned there was a required residential permit.</p>
		<p>I admit that I was in the wrong, but would like to offer the following thoughts for consideration:<br />
		<div style="margin-left: 50px">
		<p>1. There were not 6-8 signs posted in clear view. There was only one that specifically denied parking without a residential permit. <br />
		2. There were other legal spaces open in the same circle at the time I parked. If my car had been moved 20 feet forward or backward around the circle the parking would have been legal. In the spirit of the law I was relatively close to parking legally - I stopped in just the wrong spot.<br />
		3. I'm a bit frustrated that I need to pay $30 for a parking ticket when, if I wanted to pay money to park in my neighborhood that day, I could have given $20 to my landlord or a someone else selling parking.<br />
		4. Minnesota won the axe that day. Isn't that punishment enough?</p>
		</div>
		<p>I don't mean for this to come across poorly. I recognize I was parked illegally, and for that I apologize. If, on the off chance, you (the clerk or other city official) are in a good mood when they read this, I have to hold on to that small amount of hope that this will be forgiven. As thanks for reading my brief appeal, I offer in return a haiku about parking:</p>
		<div style="text-align: center;">
		    <div style="display: inline-block; text-align: left"
			<p>Back home from turkey<br />
			Where can I park near my home<br />
			Badgers everywhere</p>
		    </div>
		</div>
		If you would like more information, please send me an email at the provided address.</p>

		<p>UPDATE [December 7th, 2018] The appeal was denied. Their response:<p>
		<p>"We have reviewed the circumstances surrounding the noted parking ticket and we believe the ticket to be valid. We therefore respectfully decline to withdrawit. You were parked next to no [sic] parking sign"</p>
		<p>Touché City of Madison, touché.</p>
