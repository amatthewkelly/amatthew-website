				<pre>
				Her
				    "follow me"
				begets soft touches
				fingers dancing
				leading each other on
				and around the house
				party to her interest while
				plausibly denying mine in
				this girl looking like Looking
				Glass Alice conjuring rabbits,
				those clasp sustaining excuses,
				out from floors crowded refraining
				    “stick together”
				    “I don’t want to loose
				you” while we weave as one past
				costumed strangers striving to
				be someone.

				Our bodies both buzzing
				fingers lightly playing brushing
				hold-explore the tension
				energy uncertain within
				territory not-yet-charted
				surrounds our two-way
				understanding and willfully
				minimal conversation.

				Her fingers friendly softly speak,
				a whisper teasing mine,
				    “let's go now”
				obliging my fingers
				to again find hers and
				guide them home.

				Walking entwined fingers banter
				    "I like to be in back”
				    “My thumb is better on top”
				Her fingers smiling yield to mine
				a reply reckless, risk-taken
				though nervous, in contented
				alcohol eased admission -
				    “I’ve wanted this since freshmen year."

				Sudden unexpectedly
				her trust in my fingers ask of me
				    “I want to find love. Do you
				    believe in it?"

				Truth betraying
				yet honesty befitting my
				fingers recant promises unmade,
				acquiesce in reluctant retreat respecting
				virtues unquestionably unsought-intrinsic.
				Contending first the street lamp-lit lonely
				late October night biting cold and
				second -
				my front pockets.

				Behind a strand of soft-brown blond hair
				her heartbreak pleading "Is
				    everything alright?"
				Dodging reply my fingers necessary lie
				within deep denim darkness,
				    “I’m cold"

				Her fingers reacting
				oblivious regressing to rest
				in her coat covering the
				costume Alice keeping
				warm for the moment fleeting
				warmth for her
				finger’s fantasy wishing
				wanting wondering
				how where when I
				might magically
				fall
				in
				to
				her Wonderland.

				Front step standing her
				fingers forget where
				she placed her keys in
				her purse barely
				large enough for
				her ID and a ten. Her
				fingers searching stalling
				now lingering
				longing
				yet-hoping. My
				fingers stay safe in stiff denim,
				uncertain, unsettled.

				Her fingers whisper bated testing
				    "Text me sometime, I guess."
				    “We should hang out, OK?”

				My fingers find relief in mere embrace,
				leading me into us as I encircle
				this coat protecting
				a costume Alice
				containing her.
				The slow burn in our chests smolders,
				holds fast against stiff chill,
				both knowing it
				won't last.

				Her soft register surrendering to
				finality hangs one last
				    “Good night…”
				over the threshold while I
				curse my self control.
				Heading home my
				fingers alone. Believing in love,
				but not
				in
				her.
