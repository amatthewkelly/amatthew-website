		<h1>the law of love</h1>

		It seeps through the cracks between the letters of the words;
			It soaks my fingers and hands, running down my arms.
			I wash with it, bathe in it, and let it cover all I am.

		I consider it in my mind as a solid ring of the most pure gold,
			Radiating its beauty and overwhelming me with its perfection
			    and Depth.
		    I turn it over,
			    and over again.
			Each time seeing no more than I have before, but
			    seeing and knowing more than I ever have.

		Such is the Character of GOD. For He is Love.
			His Love is Law,
			    and his Law is perfect.

		His Love is a loyal Love, it is a deep Love and a perfect Love.
		His Love is faithful, it never ends.
		His Love is a sticky Love, a messy Love.
			It is a Love that does not merely ignore wrongs and faults,
			    but acknowledges them,
				and persists with them.
		His Love is a gracious Love and a patient Love.
			A Love that grows people and changes them to know and live Love more
		His Love is a language, a command,
			a moral code by which all creatures of His kingdom live.

		Oh Lord! I Love your Love!
			For it is good and it endures!

		Chesed,

			and Agape,

				  Forever.



		"A new command I give you: Love as I have Loved, that all may know that you are my disciples"
				    -Jesus
