		<p>Yet again I have saved this front page for a time at which I could imagine a theme worth starting and coloring this new chapter, notebook, this journal, a journey of life. And coloring is the appropriate word with which to frame this book. To color is to interpret, to define with an amount of definiteness often uncomfortable to our unsettled minds. To color is to decide with conviction. Coloring is scary because of the far reaching affects with which it casts our present selves into the future. A color is a decision crafted through deliberation and put to the canvas in committed formality - not of any ultimate outcome, but of present direction. 
</p>
<p>	As certain an act as is the application of aspiration to canvas fibers it is yet subject to the forces of time. Each stroke of the brush a window to the mind of the painter at a singular moment. As a painting is not understood through methodical analysis of its composite brush strokes, neither can our lives be understood only through individual moments, nor history from any one of her epochs. Rather we are fated to see the painting at what ever stage in its development our placement into history privileges us to observe. 
</p>
<p>	Not only does coloring derive its meaning from process and present, but from the spectrum of its multiplicities perceivable to us. 
</p>
<p>	Of all the colors, black is the most fascinating, but also the most misunderstood. It has had the desperate misfortune of being labeled darkness, void, sin, and death itself. It must be noted, to all those ignorant enough to believe this of its nature, that black is not the absence of color or beauty, but rather the color that absorbs all others. 
</p>	Why do the most formal of our social events require it and choose to be defined by it? Because black is power. Black is confidence. Black is beauty. But black is subtle in its assumption of these characteristics - it is not arrogant. To understand the beauty of black we must look to the entirety of our experience even as black is the entirety and totality of color. 

<p>	Black is the color I choose to paint with for this next chapter, unpacking it to unleash the fullness of its incarnation of the paradox of brokenness and beauty, depression and hope, Atheism and the Christ. </p>
