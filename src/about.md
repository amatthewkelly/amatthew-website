# About

currently twenty three years old. nearly a college graduate.

I believe in stargazing. I believe math can be beautiful. I believe music, art, and words have enormous power. I believe in story truth, happening truth, and plain old regular truth. I believe in adventures. I believe Jesus is the Son of Man and the Son of God, and Christ is alive beneath even the depths of atheism. I believe in spontaneity. I believe in crying for beauty and brokenness. I believe relationships are the most important things we have here on earth. I believe the Universe obligates us to live beautiful lives. I believe in warm pine needles under bare feet. I believe in long road trips. I believe in eternity.
