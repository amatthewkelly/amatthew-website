		<p>Rye High! Rye Ho! Off to lower nutrient levels we go! In any typical context, this rallying cry, this call to arms, this rousing of the blue collar Amaranth’s of our modern society would be received with levels of scorn more typically reserved for Chester’s immediate family members. But to-day was no typical day, for Chester had just come home to his new wife from his work in the University’s experimental research greenhouse with the most exciting news a young adjunct faculty member of the Special Research Division For Anaerobic and Acerbic Organically-Based Lithium-Ion Replacements could possibly have. 
</p>
<p>“Margret!” he exclaimed as he flung the door wide into their small flat.</br> 
“Chester? Are you alright?” his wife asked. He was normally fairly subdued after his long shifts tending to the mangrovian samples. </br>
“Oh yes my dear, quite. It’s simply that I feel - for perhaps the first time in a very long time I might add - genuinely hopeful about our future.” </br>
“Do you mean to say that you’ve changed your mind and want to finally start our family?”  Her tone belied her attempt to disguise her cautious optimism.</br>
“Oh no. Nothing of the sort. That’s quite ridiculous. On the contrary, I’ve become a communist.”
