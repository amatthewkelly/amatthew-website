		<h1>a writer's creed</h1>
		<p style="text-align:right">December 8th, 2018</p>
		<p> these are my words.<p>
		<p>there are many like them, but these ones are mine.<p>
		<p>my words are my best friends. they are my life. i must master them as i must master my life<p>
		<p>without me my words are useless. without my words, i am useless. i must aim true. i must press into truth with strength greater than my enemy who is trying to kill me. i will...<p>
		<p>my words and i know that what counts in war is not the length of our sentences, the cleverness of our thoughts, nor any validation recieved. we know that it is the truth wrestled over and emotion surrendered that counts. we will wrestle and we will surrender... <p>

		<p>my words are human, even as i, because they are my life. thus i will know them as a brother.<p>
		<p>i will learn of their biases, their strengths, their construction, their fibers, their direction, and their purpose. i will keep my words willing and ready, even as i am willing and ready. we will become part of each other. we will...<p>
		<p>before God, i swear this creed. my words and i are the defenders of my country. we are the masters of our enemy. we are the outflow of my life.<p>
		<p>so be it, until victory is here and there is no enemy, but the steady draughting of life!<p>

		<p>...</p>
