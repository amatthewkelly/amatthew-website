A slowly fog, the sun it lifts. 
Off coastal mountain's soggy cliffs. 
Ridgeline sitting, saddle straddling. 
My body - part, participating. 

Chilled vapors whisper, ragged roaring. 
Wraiths a whipping, whirling warring. 
Mountainous self, countenance clouded. 
Jagged steep exposure shrouded.

Cold displeased, strength displaced
From snow-melt revelation laced,
And warmth-awakened emerald face. 

As for myself? I wonder too - 
Since truth is deep, and hardly few. 
Clinging asking fragile height
Who are we - in the sunlight?
