Another Clarification: 

The email you read today was biased. 
It showed the worst of my emotional reactions.
The depth of my hurt, and extent of my anger.

It was true in every 
sense of the word but
in a different sense
so is this:

Let me phrase myself differently. 

I love Christianity.
And I am a Christian. 
Because it’s <em>completely</em> true. 
I believe in God. And I love him and
how he’s given us <em>everything</em> necessary 
as peter says in his second letter
for this <em>life</em> and our godliness. 
I believe the Creator breathed out lights
and if you choose to turn them on
it’s shockingly scary to learn monsters are real 
But instead of Atheism, Materialist, or Secular
Ambiguity, Complex Tension, or Endless Questioning
their names are Unfounded Confidence,
Assumptions, and Definite Answer. 

They say the opposite of love 
isn’t hate but indifference.
And if there’s one thing I’m not 
ever have been it’s that.
After all I think you know me as the same me 
I’ve always been you saying 
“you and me together made this
Madison Nav building up out of freshmen
friendships and fellowship
loving truth teaching and
mutual faithfulness to Our God" 

I mean I guess I just think 
you should get to know a girl
in all of her fullness
fun and cuteness
curves pimples 
past lovers
and beautifully mistaken 
first century apostles
if you ever want 
to be able to say
you know what it means to love her.
And don’t you think when you’re married 
and choosing to love still years later
it might be nice and holy and okay
to sometimes spend some time alone?

What if when he told us
to pick up our cross
and deny ourselves
he really meant it
and most won’t ever find God
because they fear becoming divine
christlike-enough to follow him
in destroying their own religion?
Sometimes hate is holy -
And I see you’re confused 
Because <em>that’s just poetic</em> 
But poetry’s existence 
is proof of it’s Truth
and isn’t the reason for emotions
grounded in truth deeper than feeling?

So maybe the reason I’m blind and can’t see
any difference between the bullshit and beauty 
Is because really, Truth comes from tension 
And it’s foolish to think you’re an ice cube
when you could realize you’re part 
of a massively wonderful whole damn burg

And I guess the point of what I’m trying to say 
is how God’s been teaching me a lot lately 
How I need to take faith seriously
giving it the respect and reverence it deserves
and it makes me really really really really sad
when the people I see going also by “Christian”
don’t take that name as seriously as do I.
